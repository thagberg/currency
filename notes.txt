Starting a django surver
========================

From the directory containing the manage.py file:
    run "python manage.py runserver"
    You can add an address after runserver if you want something that's
    externally accessible
    Otherwise, this will be available at localhost:8000

Access the django admin console
===============================

With your django dev server running, go to:
    http://localhost:8000/admin
    Username is 'admin'
    Password is 'password'
